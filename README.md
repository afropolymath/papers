File sharing service built using Flask, VueJS and RethinkDB 

This is only an API and needs a frontend.

I have not worked out how to make requests yet, or how, but 
it does run now. Certain small API changes were required.

See [Installing RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
and [Starting RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/start-on-startup/)
